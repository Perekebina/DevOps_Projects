# Linux Practice Project

In this project I will be implementing various linux commands

## 1. sudo apt upgrade command
`sudo apt upgrade` is a Linux command that updates all installed software packages to their latest versions for improved functionality and security. The sudo command gives you superuser privileges, allowing you to execute administrative tasks.

## 2. pwd command
`pwd` is a Linux command that stands for "print working directory." It shows the current directory or folder path in the terminal.
